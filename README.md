# Moodstocks SDK

## Overview

Moodstocks SDK basically let's you build [mobile apps that see](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V6Nd2TS5n8).

In practice it is a lightweight, embeddable and pre-built C library that comes with open source code samples written for your favorite mobile OS.

At its core it provides a scanner which is:

*   **universal**: it decodes raw images previously indexed on Moodstocks API, but also barcodes (EAN 8/13 & QR Code),
*   **real-time**: thanks to a synchronization feature, hundreds of images can be cached on the client side, allowing real-time image recognition that works off-line.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### iOS

*   Xcode 4.x with iOS SDK 5.0 as base SDK, for developing,
*   an iPhone 3GS or higher (or the iPad 2), and iOS 4.0 or higher at runtime.

> **IMPORTANT** if you compile your application with another iOS SDK such as iOS SDK 4.3, it will crash at runtime.

### Setup

We provide an [iPhone example application](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-sdk/tree/master/sample/iphone/arsample) that includes everything you need to start your own project.

Feel free to use it as a starter to design your own app.
